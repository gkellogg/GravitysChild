\chapter{Stepping Stone}

Guang walked south through the grain bins on the south side of our building from the oils, toward the dunbar with the milk processing plant. I desperately wanted to know where she was going and what I could expect but she had returned to her taciturn state. I followed slightly behind her.

By the time we reached the ridge we were about three kilometers from our building. We had been walking uphill for most the last k. I was winded, but since that was only true since I hadn't been doing my share of the farm work I tried to hide it. Guang seemed unperturbed.

The helicopter stood out against the white siding of a shed on the opposite side of the ridge. I wondered why they had chosen to land it there where it couldn't be seen by my dunbar. Maybe to avoid tipping off my parents? Guang would have been lucky to avoid some prying eyes in a place as active and closely interconnected as a dunbar. Maybe she just liked to walk.

My questions remained unanswered since they were unasked. Guang approached the helicopter and climbed into the left front seat. I was surprised not to see a pilot since the controls seemed to be manual. There was no sign of an AI or its telltale sensor package. She motioned for me to come around the other side and sit to her right. I walked around the nose and stepped on a little protrusion on the landing gear strut to reach the door handle. Guang opened the flimsy plastic door for me from the inside.

I dug around the seat until I got the seatbelt fastened. My legs hung over the seat but did not touch the floor. Guang helped me to close the door.

``Now Aapo, it is very important that you listen to this. Do not touch the flight controls. The stick in front of you with the handle at the top is called the cyclic. it changes the angle of attack of the main rotor blades \textit{cyclically} during rotation. That creates different amounts of lift as the blades spin around so it allows us to change direction. The handle to the right of your seat is called the collective. It also changes the angle of attack of the main rotor blades, but this time it does so \textit{collectively}, or all together. It allows us to go up and down. The foot pedals control the speed of the tail rotor blades, so we can spin around our vertical axis. Do you understand?''

I appreciated being talked to like an adult. Guang wanted me to understand! That was a great change from the way almost everyone else treated me with the exception of old Elder Mattias. She kind of spoke like him.

``Yes, I understand. I won't touch anything.''

``You will be able to later. I'll show you when we have a bit more time.'' She turned on the engine and did something subtle with her left hand on, err, the ``collective'' while she gripped the ``cyclic'' with her right hand. We rose quickly and cleanly up into the clear blue sky.

I had played with the flight simulator embedded into Curveball. The graphics in the mask were pretty amazing but they didn't fully convey the feeling of actually flying. My stomach dropped as we lifted. Guang's hands flexed in a complicated dance that brought us around the milk dunbar in a gentle arc and settled into a direction straight toward the temple fifteen kilometers west of home.

My family had to make the trip to the temple every Saturday along with the rest of the dunbar. Only Elder Mattias and a rotating skeleton crew got to stay home to keep the farm running. We would pile into the farm trucks and make the journey together. There we would meet up with twelve other dunbars for the weekly service. Mostly the kids would run around together after the service while the adults would meet with their counterparts to conduct any business that needed doing. Then we would eat and go home. The trip would take us almost a half hour in the old farm trucks, half of which was loading and unloading.

We covered the distance in no time. Less than five minutes after we left we were already on the ground at the side of the temple. A novice, or maybe a coadjutor based on her taupe robes and shaved head, ducked under the blades and opened the door for Guang. I struggled a bit with my seatbelt, fiddled with the door handle and climbed down. Someone secured the door behind me and I rushed to catch up with Guang.

TODO: The temple. He is given fresh sandles and the clean, black robes of a student.

TODO: He meets the Pulpiteer and several Coadjutors. They discuss Elder Mattias and it becomes clear that he was deeply involved in the founding of the Eliza with Garbi Elizondo. Mattias was consulted by Guang before acting on the Curveball data.
