\chapter{First Rock}

Two hundred and three Earth orbits later, having miraculously missed each of the spacecraft in low Earth orbit and most of the space junk at its perigee, Albatenius felt the gravity of a near-Earth asteroid. The asteroid's pull was ever so subtle, but it was importantly, critically present.

Another few hundred orbits. Silent, waiting, being.

The NEO didn't just pull on Albatenius. The spacecraft also pulled back, so slightly it could only be noticed over a very long timeframe. Naively, it was a classic three-body problem of spacecraft, rock and Earth. In reality, it was far more complex due to all the other small bodies scattered near their orbits. It was certainly nondeterministic over a long enough period. There was no way to tell what would happen. But one could observe and, eventually, carefully, react.
