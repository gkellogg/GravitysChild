This is a work of speculative fiction. The world it describes is a puzzle. Some people enjoy working out the puzzle for themselves. If you prefer to do that, stop reading this note before you spoil the fun for yourself.

Others prefer to read without working out a puzzle. If that's you, then read on.

TODO: Pull in notes on world description, and terminology.
